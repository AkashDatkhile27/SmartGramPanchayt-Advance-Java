<h4>Right to Know</h4>
<p>All voters have the right to know about the candidates who are contesting for the elections.<br> This right has been granted to voters under Section 19 of the Indian Constitution.<br> This Section empowers voters to seek information pertaining to the election manifesto of the candidates, their total financial worth as also their criminal record, if any.</p>

<h4>Right Not to Vote (NOTA)</h4>
<p>Voters have been granted the right not to vote, which is recorded in the system.<br> Also known as a NOTA (None of the above) vote, the voter participates in the election but chooses not to vote for any of the candidates contesting the elections.<br>In this way, voters are participating in the electoral process and exercising their right to choose if they wish to vote for the candidates contesting or not.</p>

<p>As per the guidelines of the Election Code, voters who are unable to cast their votes due to physical disability or other such infirmity and can’t cast their vote through postal ballot, can take the assistance of an electoral officer, who will record their vote.</p>

<h4>NRI and Prisoner Voting Rights</h4>
<p>An NRI (Non Resident Indian) was not permitted to vote until recently.<br> However an amendment was made in 2010 which allows NRI’s to register themselves as voters and vote in elections, even if they have not been in the country for over 6 months for any reason.<br>
Prisoners are not permitted to exercise their franchise as per the current law.
</p>

<h4>Tendered Votes</h4>
<p>This applies to an individual who declares himself a voter and seeks to cast his vote when a vote has already been cast in his name.<br> In such a case the individual can cast his vote if he can provide proof as to his identity.<br> His vote will be recorded on a separate ballot paper as decided by the Election Commission.
