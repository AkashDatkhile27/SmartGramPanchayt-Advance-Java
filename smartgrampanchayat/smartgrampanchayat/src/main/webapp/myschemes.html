		<button class="accordion">HOUSING SCHEME: RAJIV AWAAS YOJANA 2008</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>Under the scheme, Central government provides assistance of 50% of the project cost for Cities/ UAs with Population more than 5 lakhs, 75% for Cities/ UAs having population less than 5 lakhs. For North-Eastern Region and special category States (Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh &Uttarakhand) central share will be 80%.  There is an upper ceiling of Rs. 5 lakh per Dwelling Unit (DU) for cities with population more than 5 lakhs. This ceiling is Rs. 4 lakhs per DU for smaller cities with population less than 5 lakhs. In North East (NE) and special category States, upper ceiling is Rs. 5 lakh per DU irrespective of population of the city. Upper ceilings, as above, also include cost of civic infrastructure and social amenities.<br>
The Central assistance under RAY will be contingent upon implementation of reforms as per the timelines agreed upon.  The mandatory reforms include: <br>
(i) Giving long term, mortgageable, renewable leasehold rights to slum dwellers<br>
(ii) Reserving 15% of FAR/FSI or 35% of DU for EWS whichever is higher<br>
(iii) Reserving 25% of municipal budget to provide basic services to the urban poor and<br>
(iv) Establishment of municipal cadre to deal with issues of slums and urban poor.<br>

Two step implementation strategy would be adopted under RAY i.e. preparation of Slum-free City Plans of Action (SFCPoAs) on ‘whole city’ basis and Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) on ‘whole slum’ basis. Selected cities will be assisted to draw up their SFCPoA which will be an overall action plan of the ULB with investment requirements projected and prioritized for improving/developing the existing slums and providing houses including basic civic infrastructure and social amenities for the urban poor for the next 10-15 years. On the basis of prioritization of slums in SFCPoAs, cities would be required to prepare Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) following an integrated ‘whole slum’ approach with the provision of housing, basic civic infrastructure and social amenities in each selected slum.<br>
Project Approval process under RAY
DPRs are prepared by States/cities in accordance with the guidelines issued by Ministry following ‘whole slum’ approach on the basis of slums prioritised in the SFCPoA prepared by the City. Preparation of SFCPoA is a pre-requisite for submission of DPRs under RAY.<br>
 
The DPRs prepared are forwarded to the Ministry after due approval of the State level Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee constituted under the Chairpersonship of Hon’ble Chief Minister of the State. These submitted DPRs are then appraised by the appraisal agencies and place in the CSMC (Central Sanctioning & Monitoring Committee) meeting under the Chairpersonship of Secretary (HUPA) for approval.<br>

		<button class="accordion">DISASTER MANAGEMENT SCHEME AT PANCHAYAT LEVEL</button>
		<div class="panel">
		The Panchayati Raj Institution is a statutory body elected by the local people through a well defined democratic process with specific responsibilities and duties. It is the most appropriate institution from village to the district level. The role of Panchayats (local self governing institutions) is important in view of their proximity to the local community, universal coverage and enlisting people’s participation on an institutionalized basis. Panchayat and municipalities are local governing institutions in countries like India, have a constitutional mandate under the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments Act. Apart from the proper implementation of different ongoing developmental programmes, the panchayat system has to play pivotal roles in respect of natural as well as man-made disaster management. In India, Particularly in West Bengal the village level Disaster Management Committee is headed by ward members of gram panchayat. The Panchayati Raj Institutions provide adequate space to the weaker section of the communities at its three levels, i.e. village, block and district. Good governance can be an instrumental feature in poverty reduction. This study was undertaken in cyclone affected areas in West Bengal to assess the role of panchayat in disaster management. The empirical study revealed that main role performed by the panchayat in respect of disaster was reconstruction of damaged houses, crop protection measures, livestock management, health and sanitation measures. Besides these broad aspects, the panchayats officials also organized health camp, involved in rescue operation, arranging temporary shelters and so on as disaster management operation. Total 60 gram panchayat officials and 150 villagers were selected randomly as respondents for the present investigation. The data were analysed into mean score, rank position and spearman correlation coefficient to achieve the objectives. The findings of the study indicated that significant differences were observed on the opinion of the villagers and officials on reconstruction of houses and health and sanitation measures. The roles performed by the local self-government in disaster management were very poor. There was absolutely lack of involvement of people’s representative. Therefore, adequate supports are suggested on these aspects from the representatives in association with higher authorities
